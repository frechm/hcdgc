    <h1>Hub City Disc Golf Club Bylaws</h1>

    <h2 class="bylaws-h2">Name</h2>
    <p class="bylaws-p">The name of this organization is the “Hub City Disc Golf Club” hereafter referred to as the HCDGC.</p>
    
    <h2 class="bylaws-h2">Mission</h2>
    <p class="bylaws-p">
        The mission of HCDGC is to foster the growth of disc golf, play disc golf and fellowship with other players of
        all skill levels, in Spartanburg County and the surrounding area. The Club will achieve this through the
        organizing of, competing in and volunteering at disc golf events. As a Club, we strive to raise the frequency and
        quality of play on our local courses by our local players. We also strive to welcome players visiting from the
        surrounding area and to build partnerships with the local community of businesses and organizations.
    </p>

    <h2 class="bylaws-h2">Membership</h2>
    <p class="bylaws-p">
        Active membership in the HCDGC is contingent upon payment of an annual membership fee. 
        Annual membership dues are an amount set by the board. 
        Memberships coincide with the club year as set by the board.
    </p>

    <h3 class="bylaws-h3">The Privileges of a Club Member Include:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class="bylaws-li">The right to nominate club members for the Board of Directors</li>
        <li class="bylaws-li">The right to vote in HCDGC elections</li>
        <li class="bylaws-li">The right to hold a board position in the HCDGC</li>
        <li class="bylaws-li"> The right to not be discriminated on for any reason, 
            including race, creed, religion, lifestyle, or ability</li>
        <li class="bylaws-li">The right to speak up, be vocal, have a voice on what you want out of your club and the officers that run it for you</li>
        <li class="bylaws-li">The right to attend Board meetings or called membership meetings</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bylaws-p">
        Club Members agree to follow the club rules and bylaws at all times both on and off the course. 
        Non-members and inactive members shall have none of the privileges of Club Members.
    </p>
    <p class="bylaws-p">
        Membership may be revoked without refund by the Board for conduct that reflects negatively on the HCDGC or the Board. 
        The revocation process will require a Board meeting (in person or online) with or without the club member present where the Board will determine if the actions of the individual warrant revocation of
        membership. If so, the club member in question will have an opportunity to defend themselves prior to the Board voting on any action. Revocation will require a two-thirds vote by the Board. Should any club member
        have their membership privileges revoked they can re-apply for membership the following club year.
    </p>

    <p class="bylaws-p">
        Membership renewal is automatic unless contested by a member of the Board. 
        The contested membership renewal process will proceed the same as the revoke process above.
    </p>
    
    <p class="bylaws-p">
        The Club and the Board share the common goal of procuring new club members and not denying memberships, but not at the cost of allowing members in that may negatively impact the positive nature and message of the Club. 
        Therefore new membership applications are automatic unless contested by any current club member or Board member. The contested new membership process will require a Board discussion (in person or online) where the Board 
        will determine if the new membership is granted. The new club member in question will have
        an opportunity to defend themselves prior to the Board voting on any action. New membership denial will require a majority vote by the Board. Should any person be denied membership, they can re-apply for membership the following club year.
    </p>

    <h2 class="bylaws-h2">Guests</h2>
    <p class="bylaws-p">
        Guests are welcome and encouraged to participate in all HFDGC activities, unless specific events are reserved for HFDGC members only.

    <h2 class="bylaws-h2">Inactive Members</h2>

        Inactive club members have no club rights, the same as non-club members, once they are declared inactive. 
        Inactive status can be immediately changed to active status once annual dues are paid in full.
